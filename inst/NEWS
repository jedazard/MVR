Package: MVR

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2011-07-26
o RELEASE 1.00.0
- Initial release of the package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2011-12-14
o RELEASE 1.10.0
- Minor fixes in the documentation.
- The synthetic dataset is downsized to 200 variables (instead of 1000) with 40 of them (instead of 200) that are significantly different between the two sample groups.
- Major bug fix in the internal function MeanVarReg, which was not returning the correct cluster membership values. This was affecting especially the end-user function mvrt.test().
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2013-11-13
o RELEASE 1.20.0
- Now depends on 'parallel' instead of 'snow' package. This modification should be totally transparent to the users and not affect them in any way. Minor updates in the manual accordingly.
- Now supports SOCKET, PVM and MPI clusters. Manual corrected accordingly.
- Minor updates in the email addresses and references.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-06-19
o RELEASE 1.30.1
- Packages in 'Depends' field of the DESCRIPTION file are now imported from the NAMESPACE file.
- Compiled C code now uses the interface to R internal RNGs routines instead of the system rand RNG.
- Compiled C code now successfully passes Valgrind memory check. 
- Removed superfluous codes in the parallelization section, before clusterCall().
- Main function `mvr()` now returns shrinkage estimates of means and standard deviations by groups. 
- Improved codes for all plotting functions, including new graphical device arguments.
- Updates in the manual: examples are given for a SOCKET or MPI cluster configuration.
- Removed internal functions from the manual, updated manual, version number.
- Test build under 3.0.2 and release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2015-07-10
o RELEASE 1.30.2
- Compliance with new R CMD check, which now checks code usage via 'codetools'.
  Functions and packages from default packages other than base which are used in the package
  code are now imported via the package namespace file (NAMESPACE).
  Added new field 'Imports' in the package description file (DESCRIPTION) 
  to match the functions and packages newly imported via NAMESPACE.
- Minor updates of the default title values in the diagnostic plots. 
- Built under R-3.2.1 (2015-06-19) and tested under R-devel (2015-07-08 r68642). 
- Release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2016-01-28
o RELEASE 1.30.3
- Corrected inclusion of C and R headers to comply with g++ 6.0 compiler and good practice in C++ code.
- Added manual in a 'doc' subfolder within 'inst' folder.
- Built and tested under R-devel (2015-12-22 r69809). 
- Release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2016-10-25
o RELEASE 1.31.0
BUG FIXES
- Corrected missing declaration of use of 'std' namespace in C++ code to comply with C++98 and good practice.
- Corrected number of replications to match the exact same number as user request and not a multiple of the number of cpus available.
UTILITIES
- Added a seed for both end-user functions `mvr()` and `mvrt.test()`.
PACKAGE INSTALLATION
- Updated Rd, NEWS and CITATION files.  
- Built and tested under R-devel (2016-06-30 r70858) and release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2017-05-28

- Minor corrections in R and C/C++ codes to comply with good practices of
  native routines registration and symbol search disabling.
PACKAGE INSTALLATION
- Updated documentation, Rd, DESCRIPTION, NEWS and NAMESPACE files.  
- Built and tested under R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21) and release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2018-04-16
o RELEASE 1.32.1
BUG FIXES
- NA values are now correctly handled in the internal function `is.empty()`.
- a NULL value for the seed is now correctly handled in case of no parallelization 
  in the internal functions `withinsumsq()` and `sim.dis()`.
PACKAGE INSTALLATION
- Minor updates in documentation files (DESCRIPTION, NEWS and README).
- Built and tested under R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15) and release update to GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date   : 2018-09-10
o RELEASE 1.33.0
BUG FIXES
- Argument `block` now correctly handles the case of a factor when the option `labels`
  or `levels` is not used to define the factor, which could cause its levels to not 
  match the data groups.
PACKAGE INSTALLATION
- Minor updates in manual and documentation files (Rd files).
- Minor updates in documentation files (DESCRIPTION, NEWS, and README).
- Built and tested under R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) and release update to GitHub.

Date   : 2020-10-23
o RELEASE 1.34.0
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
- Renamed objects returned by end-user functions `mvr()` and `mvrt.test()` as `MVR` and `MVRT`, respectively.
- Corrected and updated Import and Depends field values of DESCRIPTION file.
- Removed deprecated Lazyload and LazyData field values of DESCRIPTION file.
BUG FIXES
- Conditional tests in internal function `is.empty()` no longer coerce a Boolean vector
  (logical of length > 1) to its first entry only (now passes R >= 3.6.0 CRAN check). 
- Argument `block` now correctly handles the case of a factor when the option `labels` or `levels` is not used to define the factor, which could cause its levels to not match the data groups.
- `Xraw` and `Xmvr` values of `MVR` object now correctly returns a matrix in all cases.
- Corrected field '\usage{data(...)}' in Rd manual files.
PACKAGE INSTALLATION
