# MVR
Mean-Variance Regularization: a non-parametric method for joint adaptive mean-variance regularization and variance stabilization of high-dimensional data


===============
### Description

Implements a non-parametric method for joint adaptive mean-variance regularization and variance stabilization of 
high-dimensional data (Dazard and Rao, 2012). It is suited for handling difficult problems posed by high-dimensional 
multivariate datasets (_p_ >> _n_ paradigm), such as in omics-type data, among which are that the variance is often 
a function of the mean, variable-specific estimators of variances are not reliable, and tests statistics have low powers 
due to a lack of degrees of freedom.

Key features include:

1. Normalization and/or variance stabilization of the data

2. Computation of mean-variance-regularized _t_-statistics (_F_-statistics to come)

3. Generation of diverse diagnostic plots

4. Computationally efficient implementation using C/C++ interfacing and an option for parallel
computing to enjoy a fast and easy experience in the R environment

See also below the package news with the R command: `MVR.news()`.

All the codes are in the R folder and a manual (MVR.pdf) details the end-user (and internal) functions. 
At this stage and for simplicity, there are only 2 end-user function, 4 end-user diagnostic 
and plotting functions and 2 end-user datasets (synthetic and real). 
See the "MVR-package" introduction section of the manual for more details and examples.

### Requirements

MVR (>= 1.34.0) requires R-3.5.0 (2018-04-23). It was built and tested under R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) and Travis CI. 

Installation has been tested on Windows, Linux, OSX and Solaris platforms. 

See Travis CI build result:

================
### Installation

* To install the stable version of `MVR`, simply download and install the current version (1.33.0) from the [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MVR) 
repository:

```{r}
install.packages("MVR")
```

* Alternatively, you can install the most up-to-date development version (>= 1.34.0) of `MVR` from the [GitHub](https://github.com/jedazard/MVR) repository:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jedazard/MVR")
```

=========
### Usage

* To load the MVR library in an R session and start using it:

```{r}
library("MVR")
```

* Check the package news with the R command:

```{r}
MVR.news()
```

* Check on how to cite the package with the R command:

```{r}
citation("MVR")
```

etc...
